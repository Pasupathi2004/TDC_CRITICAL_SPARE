# üîí Data Integrity & Recovery Guide

## Problem Solved

Your inventory management app was experiencing data loss and corruption due to several issues:

### **Previous Problems:**
1. **No File Locking** - Multiple users could write simultaneously, causing corruption
2. **No Data Validation** - Invalid data could be written to files
3. **No Backup System** - No way to recover from corruption
4. **Synchronous Operations** - Blocking operations under high load
5. **No Error Recovery** - Failed writes had no rollback mechanism

## **Solutions Implemented:**

### 1. **File Locking System**
- Prevents concurrent access to the same file
- Ensures only one operation can write at a time
- Automatic lock release after operations

### 2. **Atomic Writes**
- Writes to temporary file first
- Validates data before committing
- Atomic move operation prevents partial writes

### 3. **Automatic Backup System**
- Creates backup before every write operation
- Automatic recovery from backups if corruption detected
- Backup files stored as `.backup.json`

### 4. **Data Validation**
- Validates data structure before writing
- Ensures arrays are properly formatted
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Multiple retry attempts for failed operations
- Automatic backup restoration
- Detailed error logging

## **New Features:**

### **Data Integrity Monitoring**
- Real-time integrity checks in Analytics dashboard
- Visual indicators for data health
- Storage usage monitoring

### **Recovery Tools**
- Automatic backup creation
- Manual recovery script available
- Data integrity validation

## **How to Use:**

### **1. Monitor Data Health**
Go to **Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí **Data Integrity** section to see:
- ‚úÖ Valid data files
- ‚ùå Corrupted files
- üìä Record counts
- üíæ Backup availability

### **2. Manual Recovery (if needed)**
```bash
# Run the recovery script
node server/scripts/dataRecovery.js
```

### **3. Check Storage Usage**
Analytics dashboard shows:
- Total storage used
- Storage usage percentage
- Recommendations

## **Prevention Best Practices:**

### **1. Regular Monitoring**
- Check Analytics dashboard weekly
- Monitor for any "Invalid" status indicators
- Watch storage usage trends

### **2. Backup Management**
- Backups are created automatically
- Keep backup files safe
- Consider external backup for critical data

### **3. User Guidelines**
- Avoid rapid-fire operations
- Wait for operations to complete
- Report any data inconsistencies

## **Technical Details:**

### **File Structure:**
```
server/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users.json          # Main user data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users.backup.json   # Backup of user data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory.json      # Main inventory data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory.backup.json # Backup of inventory data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transactions.json   # Main transaction data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transactions.backup.json # Backup of transaction data
```

### **Lock Mechanism:**
- In-memory locks prevent concurrent access
- Automatic cleanup on operation completion
- Timeout protection for stuck locks

### **Validation Process:**
1. Check data is array format
2. Validate JSON structure
3. Write to temporary file
4. Verify written data
5. Atomic move to target file
6. Create backup

## **Error Recovery:**

### **Automatic Recovery:**
- Corrupted files automatically restored from backup
- Multiple retry attempts with backoff
- Graceful degradation if recovery fails

### **Manual Recovery:**
```bash
# Run recovery script
cd server/scripts
node dataRecovery.js
```

## **Monitoring Endpoints:**

### **Data Integrity Check:**
```
GET /api/analytics/integrity
```
Returns integrity status of all data files.

### **Storage Usage:**
```
GET /api/analytics/settings/storage
```
Returns storage usage in MB.

## **Migration from Old System:**

The new system is backward compatible. Your existing data will be:
1. Automatically validated on first access
2. Backed up before any modifications
3. Protected by the new integrity system

## **Performance Impact:**

- **Minimal overhead** - Most operations complete in milliseconds
- **Better reliability** - Reduced data corruption risk
- **Automatic recovery** - Self-healing system
- **Real-time monitoring** - Proactive issue detection

## **Support:**

If you experience any data issues:

1. **Check Analytics Dashboard** for integrity status
2. **Run recovery script** if corruption detected
3. **Review server logs** for detailed error information
4. **Contact support** if issues persist

**Note:** This system significantly reduces the risk of data loss and provides automatic recovery mechanisms. Regular monitoring through the Analytics dashboard is recommended for optimal data health.
